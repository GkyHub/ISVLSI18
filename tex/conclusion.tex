\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce RRAM into CNN accelerator as on-chip weight buffer. To address the high read/write dynamic energy of RRAM, we change the loop order and implement the accumulation buffer to reduce RRAM access. Up to 96\% energy is saved with this optimization. To fully utilize the large capacity of RRAM buffer, we explore the possibility to keep weights in on-chip buffer to further reduce off-chip memory access based on existing scheduling strategies. Experimental results show that this strategy reduces 85\% more DDR read as the weight buffer size increases when compared with existing scheduling strategy. With the hardware and scheduling optimiation, RRAM based design saves 12-18\% system energy with a 15-75\% smaller on-chip RAM area compared with SRAM design. Future work should focus on the rest part of the energy cost like the leakage energy of DDR and the computation energy.
